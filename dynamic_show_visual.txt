You can create a DAX measure that returns a value indicating whether the specific value exists in the table, and then use this measure to control the visibility of a visual.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Create a DAX Measure to Check for Value Existence:

Suppose you want to check if a specific value (e.g., TargetValue) exists in your table named DataTable under the column ColumnToCheck.
DAX
Copy code
ValueExistsFlag = 
IF(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(DataTable, DataTable[ColumnToCheck] = "TargetValue")) > 0,
    1,
    0
)
This measure returns 1 if the value "TargetValue" exists in the column, otherwise it returns 0.
Create a Card Visual for Controlling Visibility:

Add a Card visual to your report and place the ValueExistsFlag measure in it.
This card will either display 1 or 0 based on the existence of the value.
Conditional Formatting for Other Visuals:

Add the visual you want to conditionally show or hide.
Go to the Visualizations pane > Format tab of that visual.
Expand the "Visibility" settings (may appear as Filters depending on the visual).
Use Conditional Formatting to set the visual’s transparency or any element’s property (such as the value or color) based on ValueExistsFlag.
If ValueExistsFlag is 1, you can set it to make the visual fully visible. If it is 0, set the transparency to 100%, effectively hiding the visual.
